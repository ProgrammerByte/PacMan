# PacMan
A complete version of PacMan made with C++ and OpenGL. All four ghosts have been implemented alongside their four states (chase, scatter, frightened, and eaten). The more levels the player completes the harder the game gets (in the form of reduced scatter and frightened times). The game ends as soon as the player loses all of their lives. To play the game you only need to download and run the "Template" executable in the "Release" folder.
